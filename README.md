# solana-falcon512

Pure-Rust **Falcon-512 signature verification**, optimised for Solana SBF programs.

- `no_std`, allocation-free, zero non-essential dependencies.
- Compressed-format signatures (header byte `0x39`) only.
- **~173–183k compute units per verify** on Solana SBF with a prepared pubkey
  (rejection sampling is not constant-time — see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)).
- Zero-copy borrow APIs (`from_ref`, `try_from_slice`) so signatures and prepared pubkeys can be verified directly from runtime input / account data with no memcpy.
- A versioned Solana account wrapper for prepared pubkeys, so multi-tenant
  programs can standardize account-backed verification instead of inventing
  their own bytes layout.
- Prepared pubkey storage: **1024 bytes** (one u16 per NTT coefficient, since each value is `< Q < 2^14`).
- Cross-checked against NIST SHAKE-256 KATs and 1,000,000 PQClean-generated signatures with zero failures.

## Usage

### Runtime pubkey

```rust
use solana_falcon512::{Falcon512Pubkey, Falcon512Signature};

let pubkey = Falcon512Pubkey::try_from(&pk_bytes[..])?;
let signature = Falcon512Signature::try_from(&sig_bytes[..])?;
let ok = signature.verify(message, &pubkey);
```

### Compile-time prepared pubkey (recommended for Solana programs)

If your program embeds a fixed pubkey, prepare it at compile time. `prepare_pubkey()` is a `const fn` — the decoded NTT-form pubkey is baked into the binary, saving ~99k CUs on every verify:

```rust
use solana_falcon512::{Falcon512Pubkey, Falcon512PreparedPubkey, Falcon512Signature};

const PREPARED: Falcon512PreparedPubkey =
    Falcon512Pubkey::from_bytes(*include_bytes!("../keys/falcon.pk"))
        .prepare_pubkey();

let ok = signature.verify_with_prepared(message, &PREPARED);
```

A malformed pubkey will fail at compile time rather than panic at runtime.

### Runtime prepared pubkey (multi-tenant programs)

If your program verifies against a different pubkey per account/user — i.e.
the pubkey isn't known at compile time — store the **prepared** form on-chain
instead of the raw 897-byte wire encoding. Each verify then loads the NTT-form
pubkey directly and skips the ~99k-CU decode + forward NTT.

The trade-off is 1024 bytes of prepared coefficients, or **1036 bytes** if you
wrap them in the crate's versioned `Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount`
account format (8-byte discriminator + 4-byte version). Anything that gets
verified multiple times recoups that rent cost easily in saved compute.

For runtime preparation, `prepare_pubkey()`'s `const` form would `panic!` on a
malformed wire pubkey — fine at compile time (becomes a build error), but
unhelpful at runtime where you want to surface the error and reject the
instruction. Use `try_prepare_pubkey()` (or the equivalent
`TryFrom<Falcon512Pubkey>` / `TryFrom<&Falcon512Pubkey>` impls) for the
runtime path — it returns `Result<Falcon512PreparedPubkey, ProgramError>`
with `Err(InvalidArgument)` on header / coefficient / trailing-bit issues.

```rust
use solana_falcon512::{
    Falcon512PreparedPubkey, Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount, Falcon512Pubkey,
    Falcon512Signature,
};

// On registration: prepare once, wrap it in the canonical Solana account
// layout, and write that account body on-chain.
let pk = Falcon512Pubkey::try_from(&pk_wire_bytes[..])?;
let prepared: Falcon512PreparedPubkey = (&pk).try_into()?;        // TryFrom
// or, equivalently:
let prepared = pk.try_prepare_pubkey()?;                            // method
let account = Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount::new(prepared);
account_data.copy_from_slice(&account.to_bytes());

// On verify: borrow the prepared pubkey directly out of the account wrapper —
// no copy, no allocation. `try_from_slice` validates discriminator, version,
// length, and alignment.
let prepared_account = Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount::try_from_slice(&account_data[..])?;
let signature = Falcon512Signature::try_from_slice(sig_bytes)?;
let ok = signature.verify_with_prepared(message, prepared_account.prepared_pubkey());
```

### Solana account-backed verifier pattern

The example program in `program/` now supports both:

- zero accounts: verify against a compile-time prepared pubkey baked into the binary
- one readonly, program-owned account: verify against a `Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount`

That makes the example useful for the real multi-tenant flow Solana programs
actually need: register a Falcon pubkey once, store its prepared form in a PDA,
then verify many signatures later by passing only the signature, message, and
prepared-key account.

### Zero-copy borrow APIs

All three byte-array wrappers are `#[repr(transparent)]` and expose
zero-copy borrow constructors:

```rust
// From a fixed-size array reference (no length check, no copy):
let sig: &Falcon512Signature = Falcon512Signature::from_ref(&sig_bytes_array);
let pk:  &Falcon512Pubkey    = Falcon512Pubkey::from_ref(&pk_bytes_array);
let prepared: &Falcon512PreparedPubkey =
    unsafe { Falcon512PreparedPubkey::from_ref(&pp_bytes_array) }; // 2-byte aligned

// From a slice (length checked + alignment checked, still no copy):
let sig      = Falcon512Signature::try_from_slice(&sig_slice)?;
let pk       = Falcon512Pubkey::try_from_slice(&pk_slice)?;
let prepared = Falcon512PreparedPubkey::try_from_slice(&pp_slice)?;
```

The Solana entrypoint pattern below avoids the 666-byte signature memcpy and
the 1024-byte prepared-pubkey memcpy that owned-array constructors would
emit — the verify operates directly on the runtime-provided buffers:

```rust
let signature = Falcon512Signature::from_ref(sig_bytes); // borrowed from input
signature.verify_with_prepared(message, &PREPARED_PUBKEY)
```

### Prepared pubkey: a blockchain-specific optimisation

A standard Falcon verifier sees each pubkey once and discards it — there's
no point caching intermediate state. On a blockchain, the same pubkey is
verified against many signatures over its lifetime and you pay rent for
storage, so the economics flip: it pays to bake the deterministic-from-`h`
work into account data and skip it on every verify.

Three transformations baked into `Falcon512PreparedPubkey`:

1. **Decode + forward NTT** of `h`, eliminating the per-verify 14-bit
   unpacking and 9-level NTT (~95k CUs saved per verify).
2. **Pre-fold `N⁻¹ mod q`** into each coefficient. The inverse NTT
   normally ends with a `× (1/N)` scalar pass; pre-folding lets the
   runtime skip it. `inv_NTT(prepared · NTT(s2)) = (h · s2 · N) · N⁻¹ =
   h · s2`.
3. **Narrow `u32 → u16`**. NTT coefficients are `< q < 2^14`, so u16 is
   enough — halves on-chain rent (1024 bytes vs 2048) at zero CU cost
   (SBF `ldxh` costs the same as `ldxw`).

The wire format (1024-byte little-endian `[u16; 512]`) is **specific to
this crate**: other Falcon implementations' NTT-form pubkeys store
`NTT(h)` without `N⁻¹` and as u32, so they won't round-trip. That's
intentional. The 897-byte standard wire pubkey is still the
interoperability boundary — accept it via [`Falcon512Pubkey::try_from`],
prepare once with [`Falcon512Pubkey::try_prepare_pubkey`] (or the `const`
panicking [`Falcon512Pubkey::prepare_pubkey`] for compile-time keys), and
store the result. If you want a stable PDA layout instead of raw bytes, wrap
the prepared key in [`Falcon512PreparedPubkeyAccount`] and pay a further
12-byte metadata overhead for discriminator + versioning.

## Benchmarks

Measured via Mollusk SVM, default optimised build (`lto = "fat"`,
`opt-level = 3`, `codegen-units = 1`), with the entrypoint borrowing the
signature in place via `Falcon512Signature::from_ref`:

| Path                                 | CUs            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `verify_with_prepared` (success)     | ~186241        |
| `verify_with_prepared` (rejection)   | ~186281–186306 |
| `verify_with_prepared` via account   | ~186445        |
| `verify` (raw pubkey)                | ~270k          |

The small CU spread on the prepared path reflects per-signature variance
in `hash_to_point`: each Falcon signature embeds a fresh random nonce, and
SHAKE-256 rejection sampling in `hash_to_point` consumes a variable number
of permutations depending on how many `< 5q` candidates land in each
absorbed block (typically 8–10 permutations, ~95% of the variance). The
algorithm work is identical; only the keccak count differs. A safe
compute-unit budget for either prepared path is
`set_compute_unit_limit(195_000)`.

Notable points along the optimisation curve (start of the journey vs. now,
`verify_with_prepared`):

## Project layout

- `src/` — verify library (`no_std`, rlib only). Zero non-essential deps.
- `host-tests/` — separate crate hosting the integration tests
  (e2e / fuzz / soak) so the main crate doesn't pull in `pqcrypto-falcon`,
  `rayon`, etc. as dev-deps.
- `program/` — Solana example verifier supporting both baked-in and
  account-backed prepared pubkeys.
- `program/tests/` — Mollusk SBF tests against the actual `.so`.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace                              # lib unit + e2e + fuzz
cargo test --workspace --release -- --ignored       # 100k-iter soak (~40s),
                                                    # plus PQClean differential and
                                                    # 10M-iter random-rejection soak
(cd program && cargo test-sbf)                      # SBF tests via Mollusk
```

The e2e tests include:

- `prepared_pubkey_roundtrip_matches_direct_verify` for the raw 1024-byte prepared form
- `prepared_pubkey_account_roundtrip_matches_direct_verify` for the versioned account wrapper
- Mollusk program tests for both baked-in and account-backed verification paths

### Regenerating the example keypair

The Solana program in `program/` embeds a Falcon-512 keypair at
`program/tests/fixtures/falcon.{pk,sk}` for its compile-time prepared pubkey
and Mollusk tests. To regenerate:

```rust
use pqcrypto_falcon::falcon512;
use pqcrypto_traits::sign::{PublicKey, SecretKey};

let (pk, sk) = falcon512::keypair();
std::fs::write("program/tests/fixtures/falcon.pk", pk.as_bytes()).unwrap();
std::fs::write("program/tests/fixtures/falcon.sk", sk.as_bytes()).unwrap();
```

## Security

**This crate is not audited.** Use at your own risk for protecting anything of value.

Verification operates exclusively on public data (signature, pubkey, message), so the implementation is deliberately not constant-time — it short-circuits on header / length / decompression failures and on the running L2 norm exceeding the bound. None of those leak secret information.

For the underlying cryptography see [Falcon][falcon] and [NIST FN-DSA / FIPS 206][fndsa].

### Common footguns

#### 1. Wire-format validity does not constitute a valid pubkey

`Falcon512Pubkey::prepare_pubkey` only validates the wire format (header byte, 14-bit packed coefficients within `[0, q)`, no trailing bits). Cryptographically confirming that a pubkey `h` came from real key generation — i.e. that `h = g · f⁻¹ mod q` for some short `(f, g)` trapdoor — is impossible without the trapdoor itself. Thus, a user can submit any 897-byte buffer that parses, even one with no corresponding secret key. If this is important for your use case, consider verifying that a key is legitimate with a signature challenge.

#### 2. Signatures are non-deterministic and non-unique

Falcon signing samples a fresh 40-byte nonce per signature, so `sign(sk, msg)` returns a *different* 666-byte signature every time. The same `(msg, pk)` has many valid signatures. As such, just as is the case with other signature schemes, it is important not to ever dedup by signature value.

#### 3. No built-in domain separation

`hash_to_point` digests `SHAKE256(nonce ‖ message)` with no extra prefix. If the same Falcon keypair is used across two protocols (e.g. authentication and payments), a signature produced for protocol A may be replayable in protocol B if their message formats happen to overlap. Consider using domain separation in your message to avoid this issue.

#### 4. Compressed format only

This crate only accepts the standard compressed signature (header `0x39`) format of Falcon512. Padded (`0x49`) and CT-format signatures are deemed invalid.

#### 5. Solana transaction size

A raw Falcon-512 verification touches ~666 bytes of signature + ~897 bytes of pubkey, exceeding Solana's **1232-byte legacy-transaction limit**. Consider storing a prepared pubkey in a PDA (1024 bytes — fits within the typical PDA size budget) to get around this limitation: only the 666-byte signature then needs to come in via the instruction.

#### 6. Security level

Falcon-512 targets NIST PQC level 1: ~128-bit classical / ~117-bit post-quantum security which is suitable for short-to-medium-lifetime authorisation. Consider periodically rotating keys.
